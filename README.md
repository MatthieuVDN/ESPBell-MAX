# ESPBell-MAX and [ESPBell-LITEl](https://github.com/PricelessToolkit/ESPBell-LITE)
ESPBell-MAX "IoT Intercom / Doorbell" module specifically made for Home Assistant, enables you to stay informed whenever someone rings your doorbell or presses the intercom button. Upon receiving an interactive notification, you have the convenience to either promptly open the door or choose to dismiss the alert by simply tapping the button within the notification.

## PCB Assembly
This project is open-source, allowing you to assemble ESPBell-MAX on your own. To simplify this process, I've provided an "Interactive HTML Boom File" located in the PCB folder. This interactive file helps you identify where to solder each component and polarity, reducing the chances of errors to a minimum. But if you don't feel confident in assembling it yourself, you can always opt to purchase a pre-assembled board from my [Shop](https://www.pricelesstoolkit.com)

## ESPBell-MAX Code Configuration
### Used Arduino Libraries
```c
#include "ESP8266WiFi.h"
#include <PubSubClient.h>
```
### All configurations are done in the file "config.h"
```c
#define WIFI_SSID "Your_WIFI_SSID"
#define WIFI_AUTH "Your_WIFI_Password"
#define DATA_WIFI_CH 6 // Put your Wi-Fi channel and disable channel hopping in your WI-FI Access Point
#define DATA_WIFI_BSSID {0xAA, 0xAA, 0xAA, 0xAA, 0xAA, 0xAA} // Change only AA part.
```
```c
// IP address, network mask, Gateway, DNS
#define DATA_IPADDR IPAddress(192,168,99,2) // Use IP address outside of DHCP Range 
#define DATA_IPMASK IPAddress(255,255,255,0)
#define DATA_GATEWY IPAddress(192,168,99,1)
#define DATA_DNS1   IPAddress(192,168,99,1)
```
```c
const char* mqtt_username = "Your_MQTT_Username";
const char* mqtt_password = "Your_MQTT_Password";
const char* mqtt_server = "MQTT/HomeAssistant_IP";
const int mqtt_port = 1883;
```
```c
// 1000 = 1s"
const long upTime = 15000;  // How long to wait after wakeup before powering off "Latch PIN to LOW" 
const long openTime = 2000;  // How long relays is on.
int autoOff = 1; // 0 = DISABLE / 1 = ENABLE // Powering off automatically after "openTime" // if is set to 0 ESPBell will power down after upTime.
```

### Solid-state relays are controlled by publishing the MQTT payload
MQTT Command Topic is "homeassistant/sensor/espbell-max/command" Payload is "00" The first digit is controlling R1 second digit R2.

* "01" R1=OFF R2=ON
* "11" R1=ON R2=ON
* "10" R1=ON R2=OFF
* "00" R1=OFF R2=OFF


## Home Assistant Configuration
Here is a multi-user configuration, which means that a message is sent to several family members. If one family member clicks on the notification, the notification disappears from the other phones. For all this to work we need to create three automation, but before that, in this example, you need to change a few things.
- Image file path that is used as a background for Notification.
- The name of the mobile device that is connected to the Home Assistant. In my case, it's "doogee_v20pro" and "Second_Phone"
```

- service: notify.mobile_app_doogee_v20pro
- service: notify.mobile_app_Second_Phone

```


### Automation _1_
This automation sends an interactive notification with the "tag: intercom" to phones.

<details>
  <summary>Explanation click here</summary>
  Alias: This is a user-defined name or label for the automation. In this case, it's given the name "ðŸ”” Intercom DoorBell Notification," which suggests that it's related to receiving notifications for an intercom or doorbell event.

Description: This field is left empty, so there's no additional description provided for this automation.

Trigger: The trigger specifies the event or condition that will start the automation. In this case, it is triggered when the state of the "binary_sensor.espbell_max_bell" changes to "on." This implies that the automation will run when the binary sensor named "espbell_max_bell" switches from an off state to an on state.

Condition: There are no additional conditions specified. This means the automation will proceed without any additional conditions beyond the trigger.

Action: The action section defines what should happen when the trigger condition is met. In this case, there are two actions defined:

The first action uses the "notify.mobile_app_doogee_v20pro" service to send a notification to a mobile device. The notification includes a message "Someone at the door" and is configured with various data attributes, including a persistent notification, high importance, a specified channel ("intercom"), and a tag ("intercom"). It also includes an image file path for the notification and two actions that can be taken by the recipient: "Ignore âœ–" and "Open The Door ðŸ”“." The title and message of the notification are also specified in two languages (English and French).

The second action is similar to the first but uses the "notify.mobile_app_Second_Phone" service to send the same notification to another mobile device.

Mode: The mode is set to "single," which means that the automation will only run once for each trigger event. Subsequent trigger events will not cause the automation to run again until the current execution has been completed.

### Automation _2_
This automation clears notifications with the "tag: intercom" on phones when an ignore button on the notification is pressed.

<details>
  <summary>Explanation click here</summary>
Alias: The alias is a user-defined name or label for the automation, and in this case, it's named "ðŸ”” Intercom DoorBell ignore notification Dismiss." This name suggests that the automation is related to dismissing or ignoring notifications for an intercom or doorbell event.

Description: The description field is left empty, so there's no additional description provided for this automation.

Trigger: This automation is triggered by an event. The trigger condition is defined as follows:

platform: The trigger platform is "event," which means the automation will be triggered by an event.

event_data: The automation will only trigger when the event data contains a specific action. In this case, the trigger event is looking for events with the action "intercom_ignore."

event_type: The automation is tied to the "mobile_app_notification_action" event type. It implies that this automation is designed to respond to actions taken by the user within a mobile app notification.

Condition: There are no additional conditions specified. This means the automation will proceed without any additional conditions beyond the trigger.

Action: The action section specifies what should happen when the trigger condition is met. This automation has two actions:

The first action uses the "notify.mobile_app_doogee_v20pro" service to send a notification with the message "clear_notification." It also includes data attributes with the "tag" set to "intercom." This effectively clears or dismisses the notification with the "intercom" tag on the "mobile_app_doogee_v20pro" mobile app.

The second action is identical to the first but uses the "notify.mobile_app_Second_Phone" service to clear or dismiss the notification on another mobile device with the "intercom" tag.

Mode: The mode is set to "single," which means that the automation will only run once for each trigger event. Subsequent trigger events with the "intercom_ignore" action will trigger this automation, but it will only clear the notification once.

### Automation _3_
